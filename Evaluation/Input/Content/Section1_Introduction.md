Cimetidine is a histamine H2 receptor antagonist that inhibits stomach acid production. It is mainly used as an antacid for the treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcers, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and esophageal reflux.

The herein presented model was developed and published by Hanke et al. ([Hanke 2020](#5-References)).

Cimetidine is mainly excreted unchanged via the kidneys (40–80% of the dose) with a high renal clearance of 400 ml/min. Metabolism is reported to account for 25– 40% of of the total elimination of cimetidine, with less than 2% of the dose excreted unchanged with the bile. Cimetidine inhibits several transporters and CYP enzymes and it is recommended by the FDA as strong inhibitor of OCT2/MATE and as weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 for the use in clinical DDI studies and drug labeling.

The cimetidine model was established using 27 clinical studies, covering a dosing range from 100 to 800 mg. The final model applies active uptake of cimetidine into the liver by OCT1,
uptake into the kidney by OAT3 and secretion from the kidney into the urine by MATE1, as well
as an unspecific hepatic clearance and passive renal glomerular filtration.  

The herein presented model building and evaluation report evaluates the performance of the PBPK model for cimetidine in (healthy) adults.
