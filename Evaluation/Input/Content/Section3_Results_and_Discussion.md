The PBPK model for efavirenz was developed and evaluated using publicly available clinical pharmacokinetic data from studies listed in [Section 2.2.2](#222-Clinical-Data).

The next sections show:

1. the final model parameters for the building blocks: [Section 3.1](#31-Final-Input-Parameters).
2. the overall goodness of fit: [Section 3.2](#32-Diagnostics-Plots).
3. simulated vs. observed concentration-time profiles for the clinical studies used for model building and for model verification: [Section 3.3](#33-Concentration-Time-Profiles).
