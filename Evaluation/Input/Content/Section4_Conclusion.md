The herein presented PBPK model adequately describes the pharmacokinetics of cimetidine after intravenous and oral administration of single and multiple doses to healthy adults and peptic ulcer patients covering a broad dosing range from 100 to 800 mg. The established cimetidine PBPK model is verified for the use as a mild inhibitor of CYP3A4 drug in drug-drug interaction simulations.
