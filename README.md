## Cimetidine-Model
Whole-body PBPK model of cimetidine (OCT2/MATE and CYP3A4 DDI perpetrator drug) 

### Repository files
Within this repository, we share a whole-body PBPK model of cimetidine that has been carefully developed using 27 clinical studies of intravenous or oral administration, covering a broad dosing range (100–800 mg). 

The PK-Sim project file contains simulation examples and the observed data of all clinical studies used for model development and evaluation. For further details, quantitative model evaluation, sensitivity analysis and extensive documentation please refer to [[1](#reference)].
